# Smart-Fruit-Warehouse-Management-System

The objective of this study is to introduce an electronic nose for classifying the ripening stages of the various fruits and measuring the time
for their quality to degrade based on the character of the fruit aroma. This will ultimately help the farmers to determine an estimated time left
for the fruit to be sold or consumed so that he/she can make a better decision and increase their profit. The proposed system succeeded in distinguishing
the time left for ripeness of bananas including unripe, ripe, and overripe stages with performance evaluation values of nearly 80%.
